# Wikitude Swift Starter
A sample starter app for building an app with Wikitude using Swift

---

I couldn't find any Wikitude (AR) apps built in Swift, so I made this. 

You will need to download the Wikitude Javascript API `Wikitude.framework` from <a href src="http://www.wikitude.com/download/">here</a>

You will also need to sign up to generate a trial key and add it to `line 21` of `ViewController.swift`
